# 4th-Year-Project
The Code for all my 4th year project.

My project is based on creating clean images from radiotelescopes using the Discrete Fourier Transform and the CLEAN algorithm
This file will start off with the intial code in MATLAB using the 1D nuDFT and a 1D CLEAN algorithm and then go into using use Fourier series for the 2D DFT and then 2D a CLEAN algorithm for that as awell.

Since this code started to take too long to run, the project was switched over to C, where the same algorithm fourier series based 2D DFT and CLEAN algorithm is used. 
After this the project looks into turning this into 3 dimensions and how this cuold be implemented.
