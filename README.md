# 4th-Year-Project
The Code for all my 4th year project.

My project is based on creating clean images from radio telescopes using the Discrete Fourier Transform and the CLEAN algorithm.

This file will start off with the intial code in MATLAB using the 1D nuDFT and a 1D CLEAN algorithm and then go into using C to implement the DFT and nuDFT for 2D and 3D real and simulated data, where all scripts also inclde a CLEAN algorithm. All C scripts were run using Code:Blocks, but it should compile using any compiler.

Image.txt is the input file for the simulated data 2D DFT script, which is 3 multivariate gaussians placed in a 100 by 100 image.


vis1.txt and uvw.txt are the inputs for all real data scripts and are visibility and uvw matrices from a snapshot from the Very Large Array.
